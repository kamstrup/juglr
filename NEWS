2010-02-10: Juglr 0.2.1
========================

 * Bugfix: Read arbitrarily large message bodies with HTTPReader and thus
   HTTPResponseReader. Before this fix it was constrained to the size of a
   single buffer (1024 bytes)

========================
2010-02-04: Juglr 0.2.0
========================

 * Introduce the concept of reply-to addresses on messages. Generally
   actors should reply to msg.getReplyTo() instead of msg.getSender().
   This facilitates proper routing of messages in non-trivial topologies.

 * Fix bug in reading of HTTP protocol version declaration when reading
   HTTP/1.1 instead of HTTP/1.0, and check for correctly parsed version
   declaration in HTTPMessageBus
