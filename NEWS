========================
2010-02-22: Juglr 0.3.2
========================

 * The JSonBoxParser only allowed JSON data starting with a { (in effect - only
   objects). Now it accepts any JSON value: Objects, arrays, booleans, strings,
   and numbers

 * Properly parse empty streams in JSonBoxParser, returning null in that case

========================
2010-02-18: Juglr 0.3.1
========================

 * Properly flush byte arrays in HTTPWriter that overflows the internal buffer
   size, by flushing them in chunks. This fixes an UnsupportedOperationException
   that would be thrown prior to this fix

 * Implement convenience getters on Box that takes a default value in case no
   value is defined for the requested field

 * HTTPReader could detect end-of-http-headers prematurely

========================
2010-02-17: Juglr 0.3.0
========================

 * Remove the method Actor.awaitMessage() as it incurred a massive complexity
   on the whole actor class. Unless we can find a way to lazily initilaize the
   required locks and code paths then this method will not be reinstated. If you
   where not using this method all you need to know is that Actor creation
   and react() dispatching is now a lot faster!

 * Implement a generic actor-powered HTTPServer class and make the example
   in examples/HTTPServerExample use it

 * HTTP responses with non-ascii unicode characters had their Content-Length
   header set to the number of characters in the body, not the number of bytes
   as it should be

 * Removed HTTPMessageBus. Please use the new HTTPServer class in stead

========================
2010-02-10: Juglr 0.2.1
========================

 * Bugfix: Read arbitrarily large message bodies with HTTPReader and thus
   HTTPResponseReader. Before this fix it was constrained to the size of a
   single buffer (1024 bytes)

 * Improve javadocs 

========================
2010-02-04: Juglr 0.2.0
========================

 * Introduce the concept of reply-to addresses on messages. Generally
   actors should reply to msg.getReplyTo() instead of msg.getSender().
   This facilitates proper routing of messages in non-trivial topologies.

 * Fix bug in reading of HTTP protocol version declaration when reading
   HTTP/1.1 instead of HTTP/1.0, and check for correctly parsed version
   declaration in HTTPMessageBus

========================
2010-02-01: Juglr 0.1.1
========================

 * Brown paper bag release (forgot version bump when creating git tag)

========================
2010-02-01: Juglr 0.1.0
========================

 * HTTPReader/Writer infrastructure for requests and responses

 * Bugfix: Add unicode support to HTTP{Response,Request}Writer

 * Bugfix: Allow returning Boxes other than MAPs from remote calls
   to HTTPMessageBus

 * Bugfix: re-create the internal buffer in JSonBoxReader on reset() if it
   has been close()ed

 * Make BoxReader.reset() always return 'this'

 * Make the 'strategy' member of DelegatingActor and MulticastActor protected

 * Add a sentinel method validate() to DelegatingActor and MulticastActor which
   can block message propogation to the delegate actors

========================
2010-01-15: Juglr 0.0.2
========================

 * Make HTTPServerExample work again

========================
2010-01-14: Juglr 0.0.1
========================

 * Initial pre-alpha preview release. Release early release often as they say.
