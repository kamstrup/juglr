  Juglr  Actor- and Messaging library for Java 6 and later

  LEGAL NOTICE
  Please make sure that you acknowledge and understand the LICENSE and
  NOTICE files shipped with this distribution before using Juglr.

  SPECIAL NOTICE FOR JAVA 6
  The Juglr runtime depends on Doug Lea's Fork/Join framework also
  known as JSR166. This is scheduled to be part of Java 7, but is
  not going to enter Java 6.
  For this reason Juglr ships a stand alone jsr166.jar as found
  on http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/index.html.
  Since JSR166 adds classes to the java namespace you have to
  include it in your boot classpath with -Xbootclasspath/p:jsr166.jar
  when using Juglr with Java 6.
