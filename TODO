 * Blocking streams to avoid thread pool starvation on blocing IO
     - note that we also need to do managed blocks when creating the stream
       instances in the first place (eg. new FileInputStream)

 * A clean way to send a Shutdown message from the bus to all actors

 * A massive scale test (1M+ actors)

 * Unit tests

 * Migrate Juglr into Jumpr namespace as jumpr.messaging

 * Migrate standard Jumpr classes to jumpr.core

 * A SwarmActor, RelayActor or what's-it-called that dispatches messages
   between a collection of addresses. This should be used to obtain easy
   parallelization of actor tasks
