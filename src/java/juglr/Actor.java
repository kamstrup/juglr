/**
 * Base class for all actors. An Actor in the Juglr framework sends and receives
 * {@link Message}s over a {@link MessageBus}. All communications between actors
 * are fully asynchronous.
 * <p/>
 * A very important rule when coding with actors is the idea of
 * <i>"shared nothing"</i>. This is enforced by routing all inter-actor
 * communuications through the message bus. It must be emphasized
 * that actors should not have direct references to each
 * other. Instead they simply store the {@link Address}es of the actors they
 * need to send messages to.
 * <p/>
 * Although the standard {@link Message} class can indeed hold shared state it
 * is strongly advised to avoid this. One way to assert that there is no shared
 * state is to only use {@link Box} messages which can only store
 * simple data types (and also have the added benefit of mapping cleanly to
 * JSON).
 * <p/>
 * There are two central callback methods actors can override, namely
 * {@link #react} and {@link #start}. As a rule of thumb these methods should
 * never block in order not to starvate the underlying threadpool of the
 * message bus. There are three legal ways for an actor to block, notably
 * {@link #awaitMessage()}, {@link #await(Callable)},
 * and {@link #awaitTimeout(long)}.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Parallelizing Work</h3>
 * Each actor is guaranteed to only be handling one message at a time.
 * In technical terms this means that {@link #react(Message)} is guaranteed to
 * be called from a context synchronized on the actor. Juglr provides some
 * helper classes for parallelizing work, namely {@link SwarmActor} and
 * {@link MulticastActor}.
